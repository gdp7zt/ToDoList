# ToDoList

In this project, I will be making the most challenging app yet. It will be a To-Do List with the ability to create projects to group different To-Do items together, as well as separate to-dos by date, and week and display them accordingly. I will also need to learn how to use localstorage to store user's items on their to do list even if they refresh. This is going to be a very challenging project, but I am excited to learn a ton along the way.

Outline: 
1. Create Header, Footer, and body sections
2. Style header with title and footer with Github link
3. Create a navigation bar with two different sections. One for notes, notes for today, and notes for this week and then the other to create projects/display projects that have been made. I need to made sure this will expand downwards even if it is full. Also add the ability to click each one to bring up the main display and be able to add content for it. Also add an X to remove each project if not wanted
4. Make the main display layout
5. be able to add items to the lists that will expand downward if needed
6. Add the ability to add a date to each item and a checkbox for if it is done. Can make the call on whether the checkbox will delete the item or just cross it out.
7. Also, when hovered have a delete button display so that someone can remove an item
8. Add local storage once the project is finished

Thoughts: create project classes, item classes, also make sure that a note with a date in the next week will display in week as well as general and same with a day that is today.
