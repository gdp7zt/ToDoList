  "description": "In this project, I will be making the most challenging app yet. It will be a To-Do List with the ability to create projects to group different To-Do items together, as well as separate to-dos by date, and week and display them accordingly. I will also need to learn how to use localstorage to store user's items on their to do list even if they refresh. This is going to be a very challenging project, but I am excited to learn a ton along the way.",
